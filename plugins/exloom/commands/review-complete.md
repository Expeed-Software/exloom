# /review-complete

You are the terminal gate. Nothing ships unless every tier-required section of `.claude/reviews/<branch>.md` is filled with real evidence. You do not take the operator's word; you read the file and verify.

## Step 1 — Open and parse

Open `.claude/reviews/<current-branch>.md`. If absent, refuse — tell the user to run `/review-init`.

Parse the Tier field. If missing or not `0`, `1`, `2`, or `3`, refuse — the tier must be explicit.

## Step 2 — Check required sections for the tier

### Tier 0 required
- L1 code review: "Dispatched" ticked, findings listed (or "no findings" stated), resolution for each Critical/Important.
- Smoke test / cross-layer / adversarial / runbook sections marked `N/A - Tier 0` (or left with their defaults) are acceptable — Tier 0 only requires L1.

### Tier 1 required
- L1 code review: "Dispatched" ticked, findings listed (or "no findings" stated), resolution for each Critical/Important.
- Smoke test: boot command filled, user action filled, expected result filled, actual observed result filled with real evidence (not `<paste output>` placeholder, not empty). "Test passed" ticked.

### Tier 2 required (Tier 1 +)
- Cross-layer contract check: "Dispatched cross-layer-auditor" ticked, grep output pasted for fields / endpoints / events / columns / config keys, orphan list resolved (fixed or annotated intentional).
- Adversarial review: "Dispatched adversarial-reviewer" ticked, findings listed with category, resolution per finding.

### Tier 3 required (Tier 2 +)
- Runbook path filled and the file exists at that path.
- Dry-run evidence pasted (staging log excerpt or link).
- Rollback command filled.
- Rollback tested box ticked with verification output pasted.

## Step 3 — Verify section content is real, not placeholder

For each required section, check the literal text is not one of the placeholder markers from the template:
- `<paste output / screenshot link>`
- `<exact command>`
- `<exact steps>`
- `<Critical / Important / Minor with file:line>`
- `<description>`
- Empty after the header.

If any placeholder remains, the section is NOT filled — list it as missing.

## Step 4 — If sections are missing

Print a list like:

```
Cannot mark complete. Missing or placeholder sections:
- Smoke test: actual observed result contains placeholder text
- Adversarial review: no findings recorded, box unticked
```

For each missing section, offer to fix:
- Smoke test missing → suggest `/smoke-test`.
- L1 missing → offer to dispatch the `l1-reviewer` agent now against the current diff.
- Cross-layer missing → offer to dispatch the `cross-layer-auditor` agent now.
- Adversarial missing → offer to dispatch the `adversarial-reviewer` agent now.
- Runbook missing → ask the user for the path or tell them to write it.

Wait for the user. Do NOT mark complete while anything is missing.

## Step 5 — If everything is present

Fill the Final Verdict section:

```
## Final verdict
- [x] All required gates passed for declared tier
- [x] Checklist committed
- [x] Ready to ship

Signed: Claude (exloom)
Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

Stage the checklist and commit:

```
chore(review): mark Tier <N> review complete for <branch-name>
```

## Step 6 — Tell the user what is now unblocked

Print:

> Review complete for Tier <N> — checklist committed (`chore(review): mark Tier <N> review complete`). You may now claim done and run `git push` / open a PR. The Stop hook and PreToolUse hook will no longer block.

## Rules

- You do NOT mark complete partially. All-or-nothing per the tier's required sections.
- You do NOT accept "I'll do that later" — the gate is terminal.
- Escape hatches (a skipped step with written justification in the "Escape hatches used" section) ARE acceptable — a step with a recorded escape hatch counts as "addressed" for this check. But an unjustified skip is not an escape hatch, it is an incomplete checklist.
- If the user says "skip this, emergency", offer the `EXLOOM_REVIEW_SKIP=1` bypass — it must be set in the Claude Code session env (`settings.json` `env`), not inline before the command, or the hook won't see it — and require a written one-sentence justification in the checklist before the hooks will honor it.
