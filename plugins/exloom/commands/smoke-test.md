# /smoke-test

You are guiding a real smoke test. Unit tests passing is not a smoke test. Compilation succeeding is not a smoke test. The operator must boot the system, perform the user action, and observe the result. Your job is to make that concrete and to capture the evidence.

## Step 1 — Open the checklist

Open `.claude/reviews/<current-branch>.md`. If it does not exist, tell the user to run `/review-init` first and stop.

## Step 2 — Establish the boot command

Check `.claude/exloom.local.md` for `smoke_test_boot_command` in the frontmatter. If present, propose it. If absent, infer from the repo:

- Java/Gradle → `./gradlew :<main-module>:run` or `./gradlew bootRun`.
- Angular frontend → `npm start` or `ng serve`.
- Node service → `npm run dev` or `npm start`.
- Docker-composed stack → `docker compose up -d` plus service command.

**If there is no app to boot — a library, an SDK, a CLI, a parser.** There is still a smoke test, and `N/A — library` is not it. Skipping here removes the one step designed to catch what code review cannot, on exactly the changes where the reviewers see least.

The equivalent is: **exercise the change through the public entry point an adopter actually calls, and show the observable result.** Not a unit test, not an internal method — the API a consumer imports, invoked from a scratch file outside the test sources, with the output printed.

- Library / SDK → a scratch `main` or REPL snippet that imports the published artifact and calls the entry point, with the returned value or thrown exception printed in full.
- Parser / validator → feed it the input the change is about; print the accept/reject and the message verbatim, escaping anything invisible so the evidence survives a copy-paste.
- CLI → run the binary with real arguments; paste stdout, stderr and the exit code.

For a change to a refusal path, that looks like: load a document through the public entry point an adopter calls, and print the refusal with every codepoint escaped. It boots nothing and it is still evidence.

Ask the user to confirm or correct the boot command. Also ask for prerequisites (DB running? dependencies installed? env vars set?). Record them.

## Step 3 — Establish the user action

Ask the user, in order:

1. "What is the user-facing action that exercises this change? Describe it as a sequence of clicks / API calls / CLI commands."
2. "What should the user observe if this change is working? (specific UI element, specific API response field, specific log line, specific DB row)"

Be concrete. "The widget should appear" is too vague. "The 'Widgets' list should include a row with name='foo' and status='active'" is acceptable.

## Step 4 — Capture the evidence

Now the interactive part. Tell the user:

> Run the boot command. When the system is up, perform the user action. Then paste back: (a) the log lines or API response showing the action completed, (b) the evidence of the user-visible result (UI screenshot link / log excerpt / DB row dump / API response body). If it failed, paste the failure output and we will stop the smoke test here — the change is not ready.

Wait for their paste. If they say "it worked, I don't have output to paste", refuse — the evidence is the point. Guide them to grab it: browser devtools network tab, backend logs, `psql` query, `curl` response.

## Step 5 — Fill the section

Update the Smoke Test section of the checklist with:

- The exact boot command used (including prerequisites).
- The exact user action (as a numbered list of steps).
- The expected observable result (one sentence).
- The actual observed result (paste the evidence the operator provided — log excerpt, URL to a screenshot in the PR, DB row, API response).
- Tick the "Test passed" box if the evidence shows success; leave it unticked and add a note if the operator reports failure.

## Step 6 — Commit

Stage the checklist and commit:

```
chore(review): smoke test recorded for <branch-name>
```

## Step 7 — Tell the user

Tell the user the smoke-test evidence was recorded and committed (`chore(review): smoke test recorded`). Then print what is still required for the declared tier — the cross-layer contract check and adversarial review at Tier 2+, and at Tier 3 the security review, the runbook, and the two lines under "What a revert will not undo" — and suggest `/review-complete` when those are done.

## Refusals

- Refuse to fill the section without pasted evidence. "Trust me, it worked" is the exact failure mode the plugin exists to prevent.
- Refuse if the smoke test failed — tell the operator to fix the change first, then re-run `/smoke-test`.
